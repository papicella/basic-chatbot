# PyTorch (Torch) is the deep learning backend required by the model
# You should choose the appropriate torch version for your system (CPU or CUDA)
# The line below is a generic requirement, often resolved to the CPU version.
# If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, you might need a specific install command 
# for PyTorch (e.g., from the PyTorch website) instead of just this line.
#torch

# Other dependencies that are often useful but might be automatically installed:
# sentencepiece (Sometimes used by tokenizers)
# numpy (Dependency for many scientific packages, including torch and transformers)
